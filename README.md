The researchers proposed to develop a community disaster management system with rapid assessment and damage reporting. It is a web-based system that integrates Kobo Toolbox API to collect the data of the household and for the assessments. This system can calculate routes for the mapping of the household to monitor the affected household. The study uses the Waterfall method. With the help of the system, the community can now easily monitor the status of the people that affected by a disaster. The system is  built with Php, CSS,HTML and Javascript.

In general, this study aims to develop a community disaster management system with rapid assessment and damage reporting. 
Specifically, it aims to; 
1.	Develop a module for generating data on households, especially vulnerable populations such as children, elderly, persons with disabilities, etc by integrating with offline data collection tools and mapping of households using an OpenStreetMap; 
2.	Integrate an instrument for conducting rapid needs assessment for prioritizing the urgent needs of vulnerable populations; 
3.	Integrate an instrument for conducting damage assessment for analysis and reporting; 
4.	Develop a distribution route to calculate the shortest path to distribute the urgent needs of the vulnerable population; and 
5.	Evaluate the system based on ISO 25010 software quality standard.
